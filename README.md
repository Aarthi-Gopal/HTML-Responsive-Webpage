# HTML-Responsive-Webpage 
This project demonstrates the core principles of Responsive Web Design (RWD). It utilizes modern CSS techniques such as Flexbox, Grid, and Media Queries to ensure an optimal viewing experience across a wide range of devices.

## Overview
The goal of this project is to showcase how a single codebase can adapt its layout and functionality based on the user's screen size. By prioritizing flexibility and performance, this webpage provides a seamless user interface (UI) regardless of the hardware used.

## Key Features
* **Mobile-First Approach:** The architecture is optimized for smaller screens first, then progressively enhanced for larger displays.
* **Flexible Layouts:** Leverages **CSS Flexbox** and **Grid** along with relative units (`%`, `em`, `rem`) instead of fixed pixels to ensure fluidity.
* **Media Queries:** Implementation of custom breakpoints to rearrange content logically for tablets and desktops.
* **Cross-Browser Compatibility:** Rigorously tested across modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) for consistent rendering.
